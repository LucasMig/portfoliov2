# About Lucas

Hello there!

I'm Lucas Migliori, a Brazilian Front-end Developer (in development, I might say). Really glad to see you here. ðŸ˜„

I'm currently working on my own projects and some freelance jobs in order to improve my development skills.

Besides being "the average nerd" who's able to spend an impressive time looking at code lines, I'm also passionate about financial market's and would spend an entire afternoon talking about it.

I guess this pretty much sums it up! Please, feel free to take a look at some of my work.
